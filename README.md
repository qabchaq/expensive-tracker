 the Expensive Tracker project to help users track and manage their daily expenses. The main goal of this project is to allow users to monitor their balance, log their spending, and add funds when needed.

Key Features of the Project:

1. Budget Management – Users can view and manage their available funds.


2. Purchase System – Ability to buy different items like clothes, shoes, or food.


3. Balance Check Before Purchase – If the balance is insufficient, the user is notified.

This project is a simple tool for managing daily expenses, but in the future, it can be improved to include financial reports and expense analysis.
